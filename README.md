# Asteroid Game - Object-Oriented Python

### Project Overview

This project is an **object-oriented Python game** that simulates dynamic interactions between planets, spaceships, and asteroids. The game leverages **real-time physics modeling** to create an engaging and challenging experience where players navigate a spaceship, avoid asteroids, and interact with planets in space.

The primary objective of the game is to control a spaceship, dodge incoming asteroids, and survive as long as possible. Planets add an extra layer of complexity, influencing the movement of the spaceship and asteroids through gravity.

### Key Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is built using **object-oriented principles**, ensuring modular, clean, and reusable code.
  
- **Dynamic Physics**: Planets, spaceships, and asteroids follow realistic motion rules, including gravitational forces that affect their trajectories.
  
- **Asteroid Avoidance**: Players must avoid dynamically generated asteroids while controlling the spaceship.
  
- **Planetary Interaction**: Planets influence the movement of objects in space, simulating gravity-based interactions.

### Gameplay

Players control a spaceship using keyboard inputs to maneuver around the screen. Asteroids spawn at random locations and move in different directions, adding unpredictability to the gameplay. Planets act as gravity wells, pulling objects towards them, affecting the paths of both the spaceship and asteroids.

- **Objective**: Survive as long as possible by avoiding asteroids and managing the spaceship's movement in a gravity-influenced environment.
  
- **Controls**: 
  - **Arrow Keys**: Move the spaceship in different directions.
  - **Spacebar**: Shoot projectiles (if added as a feature).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pankajyadav8523/Planetoids_Game.git
